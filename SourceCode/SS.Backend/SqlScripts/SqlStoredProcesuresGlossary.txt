CheckConflictingReservations:
    This stored procedure checks if there are any conflicting reservations for a given floor plan, space, and time range.
    It returns the reservation IDs of the conflicting reservations.
    If a reservation ID is provided to exclude, it will exclude that reservation from the check.
    This is useful when updating a reservation, as the reservation being updated should not conflict with itself.
